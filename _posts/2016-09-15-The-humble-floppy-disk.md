Connected my USB floppy drive to Fedora the other day and my 10 year old daughter peers over my shoulder.<!--more--> 'What are those?' she asks. I started telling her how we used to load software using multiple of these wonders of creation and started to get nostalgic, until I just stopped. 'CD's and USB disks now do a whole better job' I said. And we now never need to worry about putting a disk in hoping a praying that we don't get that dreaded 'Disk read error'. Thanks goodness those days are gone. It was fun opening an autoexec.bat and config.sys file though and seeing files dates of 8 Jun 2000. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/img/blog/floppy.png" alt="floppy disk"></a>
