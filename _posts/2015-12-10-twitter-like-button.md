The Verge reports that the Twitter like button is more popular than the favourite [here](http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705584/twitter-hearts-likes-favorites-activity-increase). Twitter made the button switch in early November and its clear everybody seems to understand the like button more than favourite.  <!--more-->We think this is a good move as new Twitter users did not 'get' the favourite button. At least we now have have something on par with other Social Media networks like Instagram and Facebook. The question everyone is wondering though, is this going to boost the stagnant user growth of the social network?...We will have to wait and see.
