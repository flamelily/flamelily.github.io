Having been on the list for a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) for a while now, was interested to receive an email about a 'manufacturing hiccup' which is why there is a delay. Interesting to note the foundation has received over 200 000 registrations and these are growing at 10 per minute. <!--more-->This is an amazing number of interested people, and can only be a good thing for this excellent project. Watch this space for any updates.
