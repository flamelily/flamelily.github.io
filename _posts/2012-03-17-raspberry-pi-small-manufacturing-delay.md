# Raspberry Pi....small manufacturing delay

Having been on the list for a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) for a while now, was interested to receive an email about a 'manufacturing hiccup' which is why there is a delay. Interesting to note the foundation has received over 200 000 registrations and these are growing at 10 per minute. This is an amazing number of interested people, and can only be a good thing for this excellent project. Watch this space for any updates. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pi.jpg)
