[Google Blog by Greg Bullock](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-mail-is-becoming-gmail-in-uk.html) Finally Google has managed to sort out the issues with the Gmail.com domain use in the U.K. As the above link shows you will now be able to convert your @googlemail.com email to the easier to type @gmail.com Not many people knew that if you had an @googlemail.com address and someone sent you an email to @gmail.com you still received it. This was clever by Google to still route these emails to your inbox and obviously the Google ID (the bit before the @ sign) is unique to @googlemail and @gmail at the same time so as I see it anyone can convert their email to (theirID@gmail.com).
