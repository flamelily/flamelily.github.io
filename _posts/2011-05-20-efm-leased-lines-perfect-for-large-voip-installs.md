# EFM leased Lines - perfect for large VOIP installs

EFM or Ethernet in the First Mile is a great technology for small to large business looking to dump the old analog lines and move over exclusively to VOIP. Being a symmetric service (same bandwidth upstream and downstream) it really does give your internet that feeling of 'FAST'.  I think this will be an exciting technology for the company looking to drop all old analog lines and move primaraly to a VOIP telephony platform. It is expensive, but nothing like the costs of  leased lines or ethernet private circuits. I believe the bandwidth will be enough for businesses to use it for their VOIP and internet needs if there are less than around 50 users. Drop us an email or give us a call if you would like to know more about this technology.
