Just thought I would add a few pictures showing the Headrest monitors I installed for the back seat passengers. Movies for the kids......? <!--more-->See my original post hereÂ <http://wp.me/p2G9uP-87><br><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Headrest-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Left Headrest"><br><br><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Headrest-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="Right Headrest"><br>

**[Gareth Jenkins](#678 "2013-05-24 09:30:17"):** How did you split the video signal to 3 displays? Did you just use a couple of passive RCA Y-splitters?

**[Kevvy Wilch](#671 "2013-05-23 21:47:57"):** OK many thanks. That's a nice neat job.

**[Kevvy Wilch](#669 "2013-05-23 21:27:51"):** Hi, that's pretty cool, how did you attach the screens to the head rest?

**[admin](#670 "2013-05-23 21:33:24"):** They came with a plastic recess holder and I cut into the back of the headrest like in this video here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCn6C9YmzpA

**[Paul](#1219 "2013-06-24 21:30:18"):** Did you see any banding on the TFT Color Monitors whilst Raspbmc was running? I have a setup similar to this but the monitor is plugged directly into the video out on the Pi...

**[Adrian](#1470 "2013-07-26 19:24:56"):** How did you supply power to the 7" LCD screen? I am doing a similar setup in my car and was trying to power it through a cigarette lighter USB charger, but it only pushes 5v at 1A which was not enough for the screen. I was thinking of using the power going into the cigarette directly, but not sure if its too much for the LCD screen.

**[admin](#953 "2013-06-08 09:46:20"):** I agree, the audio from the analog 3.5mm jack is a bit hissy at low volumes. Once you are driving and kids are watching a movie, with the volume turned up, it is less noticeable. I will be investigating ways to improve this at some point.

**[Dan](#916 "2013-06-06 07:24:56"):** Hi, Did you have to run any filters for the sound? I find when a device is plugged unto the 12V it tends to get a whining sound through the speakers under acceleration. Did you experience this an if so how did you combat it? Cheers Dan

**[Justin](#1967 "2013-09-19 00:49:03"):** That noise you hear when accelerating is electrical feedback from the engine. All you need is a in-line audio filter to filter out the current of electricity.
