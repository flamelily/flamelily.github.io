The Centre for Computing History <!--more-->is a little gem [hidden away](https://w3w.co/thing.lovely.treat) in Cambridge UK. It's firstly a museum, but has lots going on including educational workshops and a range of activities and events. Opening days are Wednesday to Saturday, and you can view all their upcoming events [here](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/pages/30677/What-s-On/){:target="_blank"}. <br>

If you are looking for a day out, on your own or with family, we recommend a trip to this lovely place even if you are not a "techy" person. There is so much to see and with hands on exhibits there is lots of things to touch and feel. There is a lovely console gaming part which kids can spend hours playing some older "retro" games from the 90's and noughties. Adults are of course free to have a go too...
