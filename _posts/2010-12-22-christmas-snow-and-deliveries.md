# Christmas snow and deliveries...

I have had a lot of deliveries in the run up to Christmas and have been impressed with the ability of the on-line stores and couriers to make their deliveries. Even companies like Ocado have been 'thinking out the box' and fitting [snow tires to their vehicles](http://www.ocado.com/theocadoway/talking%20ocado/2010/snow-business.html). This is a testament to on-line stores and delivery companies as I think they realise lots of people have been staying indoors so their service has been crucial to the smooth running of everyone's Christmas. We all tend to complain about the lack of service in the U.K, but I would like to say we should appreciate what they do when things like the weather go against them....
