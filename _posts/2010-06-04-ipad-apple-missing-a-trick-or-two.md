title: iPad - Apple missing a trick or two

I think apple have missed a trick by not having a USB port on the iPad. Can you imagine be able to tether a wifi only iPad to your iPhone or other mobile like the HTC desire I blogged about previously. Nearly £100 saving by buying the Wifi only version. Maybe that's exactly why they did not put a USB port on, so they can sell the 3G version for more. And what is with the crazy [price difference](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/7692004/iPad-to-cost-UK-buyers-up-to-80-more.html) in the U.K? We always seem to be short changed here in the U.K as with [Adobe products](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2008/06/23/standing-up-to-uk-rip-off-prices/), Apple seem to be going the same way. I hope after the initial rush Apple might reduce the prices here in the U.K......we will have to wait and see. iPhone OS 4 can't come soon enough as the lack of multi-tasking on the iPad shows up more than on the iPhone. At least we can say one thing though....the iPad has redeemed Apple from the [Newton Message Pad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_\(platform\)) days in the 90's. <br><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Newton.jpg" alt="Newton">
