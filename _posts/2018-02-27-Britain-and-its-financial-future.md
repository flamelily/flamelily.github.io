Reading an excellent article the other day which we [Tweeted about here](https://twitter.com/FlamelilyIT/status/968207949498855429)<!--more-->, made us see how Governments need to 'think outside the box' these days. Especially where it comes to regulating things that most Governments are too scared to try and understand. Britian was and still is (just) a financial powerhouse and if we are going to stay at the top of the financial powerhouse tree, then we need to embrace technologies like cryptocurrencies and blockchain. We also feel we need to embrace the future of transport too, like the driverless vehicles that are so very close to becoming mainstream. Have a look at [this](https://twitter.com/TheNextWeb/status/968481935076085761) and tell us this would not make city living more pleasurable.
