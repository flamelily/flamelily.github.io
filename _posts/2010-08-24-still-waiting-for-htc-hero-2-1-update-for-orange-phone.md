There are a lot of Orange HTC owners out there waiting to get the latest Android 2.1 update and not receiving it. Well click this link below and you will see that it might be because you have not updated it to the 2.73.61.66 firmware from the HTC U.K support page. This is a manual update which you need to use the HTC sync software installed on a windows PC to do. This will wipe the phone unfortunately of all settings, apps etc, but from then on you will get the 'Over the Air' updates that do keep your settings. Follow the instructions from the link below to get Android 2.1 on your Orange HTC Hero......
