# Classic browser choice gaff by Microsoft

After doing a re-install of windows XP on a client's machine I came across this strange behaviour by the browser choice option that Microsoft have been using to stay within the E.U decision over browser choice. This is a genuine screen-shot taken by me. It shows clearly Internet Explorer version 6 after clicking the browser choice option that APPARENTLY I am already running Internet Explorer 8. Very strange....I ended up having to manually download I.E 8 and install to sort this out. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Classic.jpg)
