We have created a web application to find your nearest post box.<!--more--> Whilst at University studying for my Bsc in Computing, we had to create a mobile application. We realised that if creating a Javascript app we could easily convert it to a full web browser application. So with a few tweaks to the code, you can see and test it out [at this link](https://postbox.derekknaggs.com){:target="_blank"}. Or just type the URL [https://postbox.derekknaggs.com](https://postbox.derekknaggs.com) . 

You will need to allow the application to access your geo-location before it will work. This app works equally well on mobile phones and tablets, but the tablet really needs to have a GPS built in for it to work reliably. We plan to add features to this app in future and also release it as a mobile app. Comment below if you find this useful, thanks.
