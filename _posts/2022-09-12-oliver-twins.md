The Oliver Twins who where prolific bedroom coders from the 1980's <!--more-->for mainly British home micro's like the Spectrum and Amstrad came to [The Cave](https://w3w.co/modem.stupidly.pool){:target="_blank"} to do an excellent talk about their lives up to the current day. From their days publishing games like Robin Hood and Dizzy at Codemasters, right up to their current project [RichCast](https://www.richcast.com){:target="_blank"}. They discuss starting Blitz Games Studio and some great stories behind some of their many games they have created over the years.
