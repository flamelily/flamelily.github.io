Happy New Year for 2018.<!--more--> 2017 seemed to go by in a flash and I meant to be more proactive in writing more blog posts, but alas that did not happen. I'm not sure if anyone reads these musings, but hey at least I enjoy writing them! I read an article over the holiday about the [Long Island Iced Tea company changing its name](https://www.ft.com/content/e607a2b6-e670-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da), by adding 'Blockchain' to its name. Ha ha, the investors went crazy and its stock price soared. I did wonder whether there are automated trading tools out there as, 'Really' why would seasoned investors who know their stuff actually trade based on a keyword in a company name. Anyway how about I change this company name to Flamelily Blockchain. It has a certain ring to it...
