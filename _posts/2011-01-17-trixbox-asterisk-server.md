Trixbox Asterisk Server based on a HP Proliant DL rack server. Trixbox CE pre-installed and configured with a FREE outgoing SIP trunk from Gradwell.  Can be installed at your premises at additional cost. <!--more-->You will need a static IP address to set this up. I suggest creating a subdomain like sip.mydomain.com that is directed to your static IP address for easy configuration.  

### Only £699 with FREE trunk

If you are interested in this or need any other assistance then please call or fill in [THIS FORM](/contact-us/) and you will be contacted soon. The FREE outgoing SIP trunk will be supplied once a direct debit or credit card mandate has been set-up for outgoing calls, and £10 call credit is taken. Call charges can be found [here.](http://www.gradwell.com/phoneservices/callcharges) We can set-up an outgoing CLI for your outbound calls for a small one off charge once we have received proof you own the number. We can supply VOIP phones configured for use with the server if needed.
