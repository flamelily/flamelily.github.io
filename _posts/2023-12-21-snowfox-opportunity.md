These are ready-to-go businesses with proven revenue, a robust customer base, and guaranteed profitability from day one. All these kiosk have already been up and running for some time, which means no outfitting costs, equipment fees, or expensive leases. Investment starts from as little as £20,000 plus VAT for a site with weekly earnings around £2,000, scaling to £55,000 plus VAT for sites generating £12 – £15,000 per week.

Simply put, the more you invest, the greater your returns!
