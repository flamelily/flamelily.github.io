# Enabling Salesforce touch for your organisation

We spoke about Salesforce touch a while back, but we have now been testing it out on an iPad. The native application is really good, but you can also use the web app too, which might be useful to some who might need to use it without installing it on a mobile device. There is no Android native app as yet so those with an Android tablet or smartphone might use the HTML5 web app initially. Have a look at a screenshot of the app in use below.![touch2](/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/touch2.png) So to enable the touch in your instance of Salesforce you need active it in the settings. You can do this by going to Setup, Administration Setup then under Mobile Administration click the Salesforce Touch option and then Settings. There you will find two options, one for the downloadable App and one for the Mobile Browser App, as shown in screenshot below. Just enable which ones you need to use or both, and if you need any help just [contact us.](http://www.flamelily.co.uk/contact-us/) ![touch1](http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/touch1.png)
