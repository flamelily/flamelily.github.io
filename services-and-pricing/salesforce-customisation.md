We can offer to import existing databases from any system as long as it can output in csv format. We can create custom fields and objects in salesforce bespoke to the clients needs. We also offer a coding service for apex code (Salesforce programming language) within a Salesforce sandbox instance which can be deployed to the main organisation instance.
