Our International customers can use this page to pay their Invoices using Paypal. You do not need a Paypal account to use this payment method. Just click the button below, add your Invoice Number to the description and put the amount of the invoice in the Item Price field. Then click 'Update' before either logging in and accepting the payment (if you have Paypal) or put your card details and address to pay as a Paypal guest (if you don't have a Paypal account). That's all there is to it. If you have a U.K bank account please rather pay via a bank transfer, using the account details at the bottom of the Invoice, than using this Paypal option as we might have to pass the Paypal fees onto you.
You can also pay via our Bitcoin Address below. You can use any Bitcoin payment method like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/dashboard">Coinbase</a>
