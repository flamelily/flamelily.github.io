I"ò<p>The news about <a href="http://atos.net/en-us/about_us/zero_email/default.htm">Atosâ€™ â€˜zero emailâ€™ policy</a> a while back had us thinking seriously about the implications. Now firstly, to be clear, the Atos â€˜zero emailâ€™ is ONLY to do with internal email. In other words only internal communication between Atos employees will have to be done using other forms of communications and not email. The press, when this was reported, did not really make this clear, and I think a lot of people (including us) thought it a rather crazy thing to do. In the BBCâ€™s story <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16055310">HERE</a> wordâ€™s like â€˜stupidâ€™ were apparently used. Atos boss Thierry Breton would like this to happen by 2014.</p>
