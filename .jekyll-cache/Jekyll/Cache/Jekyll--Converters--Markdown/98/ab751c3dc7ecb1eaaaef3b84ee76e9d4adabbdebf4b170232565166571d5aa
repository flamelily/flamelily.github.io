I"±<p>Having used wordpress for a number of years now, one of the things that can be a pain is backing up your site. We have tried a number of options, some successful and some not so much. Of course when you back up a wordpress site you need to both backup the raw files and images as well as the database. There are a number of wordpress database tools for both backup and things like optimising your database. Once such plugin is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dbmanager/">WP-DBManager</a>. We have used this with greatÂ successÂ and has a number of features. But this obviously only gives you an SQL backup file and does not help if you need to fully restore a site.</p>
