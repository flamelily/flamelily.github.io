I"Û<p>I think apple have missed a trick by not having a USB port on the iPad. Can you imagine be able to tether a wifi only iPad to your iPhone or other mobile like the HTC desire I blogged about previously. Nearly Â£100 saving by buying the Wifi only version.<!--more--><br /><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ipad.jpg" alt="iPad" /><br />Maybe thatâ€™s exactly why they did not put a USB port on, so they can sell the 3G version for more. And what is with the crazy <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/7692004/iPad-to-cost-UK-buyers-up-to-80-more.html">price difference</a> in the U.K? We always seem to be short changed here in the U.K as with <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2008/06/23/standing-up-to-uk-rip-off-prices/">Adobe products</a>, Apple seem to be going the same way. I hope after theÂ initial rush Apple might reduce the prices here in the U.Kâ€¦â€¦we will have to wait and see. iPhone OS 4 canâ€™t come soon enough as the lack of multi-tasking on the iPad shows up more than on the iPhone. At least we can say one thing thoughâ€¦.the iPad has redeemed Apple from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton">Newton Message Pad</a> days in the 90â€™s.</p>
