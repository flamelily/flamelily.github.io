I"<p>There is a new Gmail feature that Google have sneaked in that allows anyone to email you via your Google+ profile even if they are a complete stranger. Someone just needs to add you to their circles and they then have the ability to email you direct (without seeing your email address though) even if you have not added them back. The default for this feature is on, but I will show you below how to turn it off. Google have added some security by allowing this to happen only once, unless you respond to their first email.</p>
