I"Œ<p>After our post yesterday it really made us laugh seeing the news today about KodakCoin.<!--more-->Another company <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/kodak-coin-ico-cryptocurrency-crypto">Kodak</a>, deciding to get into the blockchain space and subsequently seeing its stock price jump. <strong>Dotcom</strong> boom anyone? We beleive this technology is going to change the world as we know it, but we need to wait a little to actually recognise how blockchain and digital currency is going to become of some use. We have been following <a href="https://www.iota.org">IOTA</a> and can really see this technology being useful in the future.</p>
