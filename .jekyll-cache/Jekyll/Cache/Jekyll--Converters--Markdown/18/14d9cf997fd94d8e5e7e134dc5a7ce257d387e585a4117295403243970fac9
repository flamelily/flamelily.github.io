I"D<p>We have created a Raspberry Pi project to have the tiny computer do the hard work and retweet all tweets with the hashtag #worcesterfloods. We felt that all of Worcestershire needed one twitter feed with all flooding and road closure information. Please follow our twitter feed<a href="https://twitter.com/Worcesterfloods"> @Worcesterfloods</a>Â which is also shown below to be kept up-to-date. There are some great flood photos all around Worcestershire that have been tweeted so get following. <a href="https://twitter.com/Worcesterfloods">Tweets by @Worcesterfloods</a></p>
