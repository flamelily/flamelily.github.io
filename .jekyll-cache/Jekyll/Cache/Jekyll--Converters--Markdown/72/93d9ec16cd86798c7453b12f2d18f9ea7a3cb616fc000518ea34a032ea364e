I"<p>EFM or Ethernet in the First Mile is a great technology for small to large business looking to dump the old analog lines and move over exclusively to VOIP. Being a symmetric service (same bandwidth upstream and downstream) it really does give your internet that feeling of ‘FAST’.  I think this will be an exciting technology for the company looking to drop all old analog lines and move primaraly to a VOIP telephony platform. <!--more-->It is expensive, but nothing like the costs of  leased lines or ethernet private circuits. I believe the bandwidth will be enough for businesses to use it for their VOIP and internet needs if there are less than around 50 users.
