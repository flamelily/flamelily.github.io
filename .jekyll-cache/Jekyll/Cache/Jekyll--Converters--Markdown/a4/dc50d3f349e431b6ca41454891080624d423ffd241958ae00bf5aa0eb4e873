I"¼<p>EFM or Ethernet in the First Mile is a great technology for small to large business looking to dump the old analog lines and move overÂ exclusivelyÂ to VOIP. Being aÂ symmetric service (same bandwidth upstream and downstream) it really does give your internet thatÂ feeling of â€˜FASTâ€™. Â I think this will be an exciting technology for the company looking to drop all old analog lines and move primaraly to a VOIP telephony platform.</p>
