I"á<p>I have had a lot of deliveries in the run up to Christmas and have been impressed with the ability of the on-line stores and couriers to make their deliveries. Even companies like Ocado have been â€˜thinking out the boxâ€™ and fitting <a href="http://www.ocado.com/theocadoway/talking%20ocado/2010/snow-business.html">snow tires to their vehicles</a>. This is a testament to on-line stores and delivery companies as I think they realise lots of people have been staying indoors so their service has been crucial to the smooth running of everyoneâ€™s Christmas. We all tend to complain about the lack of service in the U.K, but I would like to say we should appreciate what they do when things like the weather go against themâ€¦.</p>
