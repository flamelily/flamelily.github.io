I"É<p>Herewith a screenshot showing Microsoftâ€™s new Windows 8 operating system with Internet Explorer 10 consumer preview running. We visited Office Liveâ€™s site and logged in to be told that you need certain browser requirements to view Office Live. Well Iâ€™m supposed to be running the latest and greatest from Microsoft and I still canâ€™t view one of their own sites. No other sites seem to mind if you use Internet Explorer 10 to view themâ€¦â€¦.</p>
