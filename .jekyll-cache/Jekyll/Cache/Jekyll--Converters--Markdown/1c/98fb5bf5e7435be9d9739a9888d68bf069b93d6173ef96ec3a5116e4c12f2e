I"]<p>Host Virtual are a popular virtual machine provider with a great support team.  But what I find is their biggest selling point is their shear number of OS images they have ready for you to deploy. They have over 25 Linux distributions and over 150 base images to use. They have some great VOIP images including Pbxinaflash, Trixbox and Freepbx. Also they have things like FreeBSD, ArchLinux and Slackware. <!--more-->Of course they have many selections within all these distributions. Their pricing is good and they have a London based datacentre. Click on the image below to see what they offer.</p>
