I"Þ<p>Having been on the list for a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> for a while now, was interested toÂ receiveÂ an email about a â€˜manufacturing hiccupâ€™ which is why there is a delay. Interesting to note the foundation hasÂ received over 200 000 registrations and these are growing at 10 per minute. <!--more-->This is an amazing number of interested people, and can only be a good thing for this excellent project. Watch this space for any updates.</p>
