I"<<p>To move wordpress sites to different servers can be a little complex. You need to move both the database and RAW folders and files. <em>If you are moving to a different server, but keeping the same domain name:</em> First export your database using PHP Myadmin or any other tool to get your SQL file. Webmin can export databases into SQL. Create a new empty database on your new server. This can have different names and passwords. Then using an FTP client copy your whole website structure from the root folder and import it to your root folder on the new server.</p>
