<p>This is great news for all Salesforce users as everyone moves to being more productive on smartphones and tablets. So Salesforce are moving to a HTML 5 standard for mobile and tablet access.<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/touch-300x132.jpg" alt="" /> Why is this better? This enables all mobile devices, smartphones, tablets etc whichever operating system (iOS, Android, HP webOS, Blackberry Tablet OS) to access this touch Salesforce interface. Even more crucial is it will be perfect for the next generation of touch screen laptops running Windows 8. This will be hugely beneficial to companies as access to Salesforce data will be available at the touch of a finger…..literally. We can seriously foresee that this way of access to Salesforce, will in future become the norm.
