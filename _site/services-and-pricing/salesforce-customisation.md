# Salesforce Customisation

![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/salesforcelogo.jpg)We have extensive knowledge in using and customising the Salesforce platform. We offer bespoke services to clients looking to move their Customer Relations Management (CRM) to the cloud. We can offer to import existing databases from any system as long as it can output in csv format. We can create custom fields and objects in salesforce bespoke to the clients needs. We also offer a coding service for apex code (Salesforce programming language) within a Salesforce sandbox instance which can be deployed to the main organisation instance.
