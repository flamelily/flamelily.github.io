                    <div class="lead"><p>I think apple have missed a trick by not having a USB port on the iPad. Can you imagine be able to tether a wifi only iPad to your iPhone or other mobile like the HTC desire I blogged about previously. Nearly £100 saving by buying the Wifi only version. Maybe that’s exactly why they did not put a USB port on, so they can sell the 3G version for more. And what is with the crazy <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/7692004/iPad-to-cost-UK-buyers-up-to-80-more.html">price difference</a> in the U.K? We always seem to be short changed here in the U.K as with <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2008/06/23/standing-up-to-uk-rip-off-prices/">Adobe products</a>, Apple seem to be going the same way. I hope after the initial rush Apple might reduce the prices here in the U.K……we will have to wait and see. iPhone OS 4 can’t come soon enough as the lack of multi-tasking on the iPad shows up more than on the iPhone. At least we can say one thing though….the iPad has redeemed Apple from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_\(platform\)">Newton Message Pad</a> days in the 90’s.</p>

<h1 id="formassemblycapture-info-quickly">FormAssembly….capture info quickly</h1>

<p>Being playing around with <a href="http://www3.formassembly.com/">FormAssembly</a> recently with some sucess. This is a great tool for online forms and data collection. They have a Salesforce app, Wordpress app and a Google sites tool. Not only that, but they offer a free trial and host the form for you. If you want to get technical you can even download the HTML for use on your own site. This is a great way of creating many forms or questionnaires to capture info quickly and easily, as their form builder is simple to understand and has some great ways you can customise all parts of your form. No software to install just a web app that works. With a free trial account with some limitations its worth giving it a go if you need to capture any kind of information. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/FormApp-1024x722.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><a href="#7" title="2010-08-19 22:53:35">Drew</a>:</strong> Hello! Thanks for the mention. We always enjoy seeing people make clean forms with our product.

<h1 id="classic-browser-choice-gaff-by-microsoft">Classic browser choice gaff by Microsoft</h1>

<p>After doing a re-install of windows XP on a client’s machine I came across this strange behaviour by the browser choice option that Microsoft have been using to stay within the E.U decision over browser choice. This is a genuine screen-shot taken by me. It shows clearly Internet Explorer version 6 after clicking the browser choice option that APPARENTLY I am already running Internet Explorer 8. Very strange….I ended up having to manually download I.E 8 and install to sort this out. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Classic.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="still-waiting-for-htc-hero-21-update-for-orange-phone">Still waiting for HTC hero 2.1 update for Orange phone…</h1>

<p>There are a lot of Orange HTC owners out there waiting to get the latest Android 2.1 update and not receiving it. Well click this link below and you will see that it might be because you have not updated it to the 2.73.61.66 firmware from the HTC U.K support page. This is a manual update which you need to use the HTC sync software installed on a windows PC to do. This will wipe the phone unfortunately of all settings, apps etc, but from then on you will get the ‘Over the Air’ updates that do keep your settings. Follow the instructions from the link below to get Android 2.1 on your Orange HTC Hero…… <a href="http://www.htc.com/uk/faqs.aspx?p_id=283&amp;cat=86&amp;id=136932">http://www.htc.com/uk/faqs.aspx?p_id=283&amp;cat=86&amp;id=136932</a></p>

<h1 id="christmas-snow-and-deliveries">Christmas snow and deliveries…</h1>

<p>I have had a lot of deliveries in the run up to Christmas and have been impressed with the ability of the on-line stores and couriers to make their deliveries. Even companies like Ocado have been ‘thinking out the box’ and fitting <a href="http://www.ocado.com/theocadoway/talking%20ocado/2010/snow-business.html">snow tires to their vehicles</a>. This is a testament to on-line stores and delivery companies as I think they realise lots of people have been staying indoors so their service has been crucial to the smooth running of everyone’s Christmas. We all tend to complain about the lack of service in the U.K, but I would like to say we should appreciate what they do when things like the weather go against them….</p>

<h1 id="efm-leased-lines---perfect-for-large-voip-installs">EFM leased Lines - perfect for large VOIP installs</h1>

<p>EFM or Ethernet in the First Mile is a great technology for small to large business looking to dump the old analog lines and move over exclusively to VOIP. Being a symmetric service (same bandwidth upstream and downstream) it really does give your internet that feeling of ‘FAST’.  I think this will be an exciting technology for the company looking to drop all old analog lines and move primaraly to a VOIP telephony platform. It is expensive, but nothing like the costs of  leased lines or ethernet private circuits. I believe the bandwidth will be enough for businesses to use it for their VOIP and internet needs if there are less than around 50 users. Drop us an email or give us a call if you would like to know more about this technology.</p>

<h1 id="host-virtual---cloud-servers-at-a-great-price">Host Virtual - Cloud servers at a great price</h1>

<p>Host Virtual are a popular virtual machine provider with a great support team.  But what I find is their biggest selling point is their shear number of OS images they have ready for you to deploy. They have over 25 Linux distributions and over 150 base images to use. They have some great VOIP images including Pbxinaflash, Trixbox and Freepbx. Also they have things like FreeBSD, ArchLinux and Slackware. Of course they have many selections within all these distributions. Their pricing is good and they have a London based datacentre. Click on the image below to see what they offer. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/vrlogo.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="raspberry-pismall-manufacturing-delay">Raspberry Pi….small manufacturing delay</h1>

<p>Having been on the list for a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> for a while now, was interested to receive an email about a ‘manufacturing hiccup’ which is why there is a delay. Interesting to note the foundation has received over 200 000 registrations and these are growing at 10 per minute. This is an amazing number of interested people, and can only be a good thing for this excellent project. Watch this space for any updates. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pi.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="virtual-office-in-the-uk">Virtual office in the U.K</h1>

<p>We have been looking at the options on the market for Virtual Office services in the U.K and there are some good services out there. We here at Flamelily have decided that we can offer a Virtual Office at an excellent price. I have partnered with an accounting practice to even offer accounting and bookkeeping service to those who need it. With our expertise in VOIP we can setup any U.K area code phone numbers that can go to a specific message for people or companies to leave a message. We can offer a receptionist service, but feel this is a cost most would not need or want. We can even setup conference rooms telephone numbers for conference calls with UK calls costs. We have a physical address for post if you need it and can offer a scan and email service for all post. We can forward mail to another address, but again this cost would be prohibitive for most small businesses. If you are interested in this ‘no-frills’ and cheap service get it contact with us using the contact form <a href="/contact-us/">HERE.</a></p>

<p>Herewith a screenshot showing Microsoft’s new Windows 8 operating system with Internet Explorer 10 consumer preview running. We visited Office Live’s site and logged in to be told that you need certain browser requirements to view Office Live. Well I’m supposed to be running the latest and greatest from Microsoft and I still can’t view one of their own sites. No other sites seem to mind if you use Internet Explorer 10 to view them……. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/unsupported-browser-1024x640.jpg" alt="Microsoft Gaff" /></p>

<h1 id="salesforce-touch-coming-soonhopefully">Salesforce touch coming soon….hopefully!</h1>

<p>This is great news for all Salesforce users as everyone moves to being more productive on smartphones and tablets. So Salesforce are moving to a HTML 5 standard for mobile and tablet access.<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/touch-300x132.jpg" alt="" /> Why is this better? This enables all mobile devices, smartphones, tablets etc whichever operating system (iOS, Android, HP webOS, Blackberry Tablet OS) to access this touch Salesforce interface. Even more crucial is it will be perfect for the next generation of touch screen laptops running Windows 8. This will be hugely beneficial to companies as access to Salesforce data will be available at the touch of a finger…..literally. We can seriously foresee that this way of access to Salesforce, will in future become the norm. Head over to <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/touch/">http://www.salesforce.com/touch/</a> to found out more info.</p>

<h1 id="zero-internal-email-can-become-a-reality-for-small-businesses">Zero internal email can become a reality for small businesses</h1>

<p>The news about <a href="http://atos.net/en-us/about_us/zero_email/default.htm">Atos’ ‘zero email’ policy</a> a while back had us thinking seriously about the implications. Now firstly, to be clear, the Atos ‘zero email’ is ONLY to do with internal email. In other words only internal communication between Atos employees will have to be done using other forms of communications and not email. The press, when this was reported, did not really make this clear, and I think a lot of people (including us) thought it a rather crazy thing to do. In the BBC’s story <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16055310">HERE</a> word’s like ‘stupid’ were apparently used. Atos boss Thierry Breton would like this to happen by 2014. They will obviously be hoping to achieve this using new collaboration and social media tools.<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/salesforce_chatter_logo.jpg" alt="Salesforce Chatter" /> Well what we had been thinking as I’m sure you are dying to hear is that using Salesforce in your organization could actually make this same ‘zero email’ policy a reality, by using the hugely successful and popular Chatter which is Salesorce’s take on internal organizations social media. If you have salesforce in your company then to give Chatter to your users is FREE and they don’t need full salesforce user accounts. You could encourage users to login to Chatter at the beginning of the work day, then they would be able to collaborate quickly and easily, including the ability to share files and use the <a href="https://www.chatter.com/mobile/">Chatter mobile apps</a>. There is even a Chatter desktop app which would enable users to auto-login once their PC boots up. For companies without salesforce you can get Chatter for FREE by signing up at chatter.com. To use salesforce’s own phrase, it will be ‘Facebook for the enterprise’. If you think this would be useful to your company to increase employee’s productivity and reduce internal email then contact us for help and advice. This could make Atos’ dream become a reality for much smaller businesses and organizations.</p>

<h1 id="install-phpmyadmin-onto-ubuntu">Install phpMyAdmin onto Ubuntu…</h1>

<p>From console:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This must be done from the console as some questions will need to be answered. Use Putty to login into your server and run the command above. Once phpMyAdmin is installed point your browser to http://your server ip address/phpmyadmin to start using it. You should be able to login using any users you’ve setup in MySQL. If no users have been setup, use <em>admin</em> with no password to login. <strong>To remove Wordpress posts revisions from your database</strong> Just in case you are wondering how post revision works, whenever a post is edited, <strong>a new row</strong> will be created in wp_posts table. Hence if your posts or pages got edited 10 times, you will have 10 new rows in wp_posts table. In no<strong> time</strong> your wp_posts table will be filling up and the post ID will be grow. To turn off this feature, add this following code to <strong>wp-config.php</strong>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', false);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also delete all post revisions by running this query on your Wordpress database in phpMyAdmin:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>DELETE a,b,c   
 
FROM wp_posts a    

LEFT JOIN wp_term_relationships b ON (a.ID = b.object_id)    

LEFT JOIN wp_postmeta c ON (a.ID = c.post_id)   
 
WHERE a.post_type = 'revision'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Be sure to backup your database first before performing any queries in phpMyAdmin.</p>

<h1 id="backing-up-a-wordpress-website">Backing up a wordpress website</h1>

<p>Having used wordpress for a number of years now, one of the things that can be a pain is backing up your site. We have tried a number of options, some successful and some not so much. Of course when you back up a wordpress site you need to both backup the raw files and images as well as the database. There are a number of wordpress database tools for both backup and things like optimising your database. Once such plugin is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dbmanager/">WP-DBManager</a>. We have used this with great success and has a number of features. But this obviously only gives you an SQL backup file and does not help if you need to fully restore a site.<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/WPB2D-300x237.png" alt="" /> We used to use the excellent iDrive to wordpress plugin, which unfortunately has been discontinued. We think it has something to do with iDrive’s new product iDrive Sync. We think it might be re-released to work with the iDrive sync package. This backed up all files including the database to your iDrive within a folder that you specified. We have now started using a reasonably new plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-backup-to-dropbox/">Wordpress backup to dropbox</a>. This latest version uses the dropbox App folder and you can backup a number of wordpress sites to a single dropbox account. This works well and again does backup all raw files and the SQL database. It can be scheduled to backup daily, weekly etc and stored in a specified folder. It has a few paid premium extensions like the Zip backup which will compress the backup before sending it to dropbox. We really like it, as you can have the dropbox app on your desktop machine and always have a local copy of your website without having to do anything. One quirky thing which we have yet to find out why, is that if you set it to backup a fresh site and then log out of wordpress it can take sometimes days to complete. And these aren’t big websites, some around 50MB etc. It seems to be much quicker if you set the first backup on a fresh site and leave the browser open and logged in. Very strange. Anyway if you don’t like plugins you could always manually backup using FTP for your RAW files and then something like PHPmyAdmin to backup your wordpress database. Hope this helps someone when considering how to backup your wordpress site.</p>

<h1 id="moving-a-wordpress-site-to-a-different-server">Moving a wordpress site to a different server….</h1>

<p>To move wordpress sites to different servers can be a little complex. You need to move both the database and RAW folders and files. <em>If you are moving to a different server, but keeping the same domain name:</em> First export your database using PHP Myadmin or any other tool to get your SQL file. Webmin can export databases into SQL. Create a new empty database on your new server. This can have different names and passwords. Then using an FTP client copy your whole website structure from the root folder and import it to your root folder on the new server. Then the most important thing is <strong>EDIT</strong> the config.php file on the new server. As shown below you need to change the database name, user name and password to your new settings. If you created the database with the same name, user and password you don’t need to do this. Be aware of the Mysql Hostname. If your database is on the same server as your website files then leave this as ‘localhost’ else put the IP address of the database server. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/config.png" alt="" /> <em>If you are moving to a different server, but changing the domain name:</em> Do all the same above to move the database and files to the new server. Change the config.php file to match the new settings. MOST important is to then use a database query tool like PHP Myadmin as shown below in the RED circle and edit TWO lines in the wp_options table. You need to change the values on these two lines to be the new domain you want to use.  The lines to change are ‘siteurl’ and ‘home’. You might need to go to the next page of lines in PHP Myadmin to see the ‘home’ line. After doing this it is important to check any links and images in wordpress to see that they are not pointing to the old site URL like http://www.old-domain.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/test.jpg instead of http://www.new-domain.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/test.jpg. These can be easily updated in the Media section of the wordpress dashboard. <img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/siteurl.png" alt="" /> <img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/homeurl.png" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="enabling-salesforce-touch-for-your-organisation">Enabling Salesforce touch for your organisation</h1>

<p>We spoke about Salesforce touch a while back, but we have now been testing it out on an iPad. The native application is really good, but you can also use the web app too, which might be useful to some who might need to use it without installing it on a mobile device. There is no Android native app as yet so those with an Android tablet or smartphone might use the HTML5 web app initially. Have a look at a screenshot of the app in use below.<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/touch2.png" alt="touch2" /> So to enable the touch in your instance of Salesforce you need active it in the settings. You can do this by going to Setup, Administration Setup then under Mobile Administration click the Salesforce Touch option and then Settings. There you will find two options, one for the downloadable App and one for the Mobile Browser App, as shown in screenshot below. Just enable which ones you need to use or both, and if you need any help just <a href="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/contact-us/">contact us.</a> <img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/touch1.png" alt="touch1" /></p>

<h1 id="gmail-help-part-1---using-the-googlemail-filter">Gmail Help Part 1 - Using the googlemail filter</h1>

<p>We are going to do a series on using Gmail which should hopefully be useful to a number of people, especially since Android for smartphones and tablets is becoming more widespread. Firstly we are going to show you how to use filters. Filters that you setup in browser based gmail will action before you get emails to your smartphone or tablet, so can be very useful. We get asked all the time about the best ways to setup and use Gmail in all types of situations. Be aware that Google Apps uses most of the tools and settings that Gmail uses, so these will work for Google Apps email addresses too. Filters are a great way to sort your emails either into labels (Gmail’s version of Folders) or forward certain emails to another address or even directly delete certain emails. These are automatic ‘actions’ that are performed on your emails automatically before you view them. [caption id=”attachment_442” align=”aligncenter” width=”718”]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/filter1.png" alt="Creating a gmail filter" /> Creating a gmail filter[/caption] As shown in the screenshot above you first need create the criteria for your filter. You get to filters by going into settings and then clicking on the filters tab. Then click Create Filter and you will see the above view.</p>

<ul>
  <li>From - This is used to filter emails from a certain email address or person (Can just be their name does not have to be the email address)</li>
  <li>To - Similar to above, but just filtering who the email was sent to, rather than from. (Can be useful if you have other email addresses forwarded to your Gmail account)</li>
  <li>Subject - Self explanatory. Words or phrases in the subject line of an email</li>
  <li>Includes the words - This is used for words in the body of the email</li>
  <li>
    <p>Doesn’t have - For filtering by words that are not in the email body (so will find emails without the text you put in here)
[caption id=”attachment_443” align=”aligncenter” width=”717”]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/filter2.png" alt="filter2" /> Filter action rules[/caption] The next screenshot above shows the ‘actions’ to perform on the filtered messages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Skip the inbox - this basically does not put the ‘Inbox’ label on the email. (See italicized text below about archiving)</li>
  <li>Mark as read - Marks the email as read.</li>
  <li>Star it - adds the starred label to the email so it will have the gmail star shown in yellow</li>
  <li>Apply the label - This apply’s either an existing label or you can create a new label of your own. (your own label will then show down the left column and you can also choose a colour for it)</li>
  <li>Forward it to - Forward the email to another email address. You will need to have access to this address initially as you will have to confirm it by following instructions in an email sent to that address.</li>
  <li>Delete it - Deletes the email by placing it in the bin (where it will stay for 30 days and then be permanently deleted)</li>
  <li>Never send to Spam - Will not place the email into spam</li>
  <li>Always mark as important - Adds the important tag to the email</li>
  <li>Never mark as important - always leaves the important tag off the email</li>
  <li>Also apply filter to - This last option is very useful as you can tick this to ‘action’ your current emails with your chosen criteria.
Then click create filter when you are happy with your selected options. <em><strong>To archive or not to archive…</strong></em> <em>Gmail uses labels rather than folders like Outlook. When we talk about archiving, basically that is removing all labels from the message. Yes ‘Inbox’ is considered a label so when a message is archived it will show only in the All Mail part of Gmail. So if a message has a label like Inbox or one you have created, it will also show in All Mail with the label attached to it. Basically using labels reduces the possibility of having duplicate email messages as when you add a label it is just a tag on that email and it does not create a copy.</em></li>

<h1 id="gmail-help-part-2---retrieving-and-sending-from-other-accounts">Gmail Help Part 2 - Retrieving and sending from other accounts</h1>

<p>Gmail has the ability to collect mail from other email accounts (using pop3) and also send emails as though they were sent from another email address. This is a very useful feature especially these days with users having more and more email addresses to keep track of. This enables you to have one Inbox which you can see all your emails in, and even send replies from other addresses. <strong>Adding a POP3 email address to be retrieved by gmail</strong> [caption id=”attachment_448” align=”aligncenter” width=”1306”]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gmail1.png" alt="gmail1" /> Adding a POP3 email account to your Gmail[/caption] Go into settings, accounts and imports and click on ‘add a POP3 mail account you own’ and then enter the email address in the box provided, then click ‘Next Step’. [caption id=”attachment_449” align=”aligncenter” width=”568”]<img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gmail1a.png" alt="gmail1a" /> Adding a mail account you own[/caption] The next stage is to add all the POP3 details like the username (usually the email address), password and server with port numbers etc. You might need to get these details from your email service provider. You can also set things like whether you want to leave a copy on the server (useful if you have this account setup elsewhere), use a secure connection and whether to label the messages. Once you have done this just click ‘Add Account’ and gmail will test your settings and finish. <strong>Adding a Send From email address</strong> [caption id=”attachment_450” align=”aligncenter” width=”1524”]<img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gmail2.png" alt="gmail2" /> Send mail as another address you own[/caption] After adding the email for gmail to retrieve you can now add it as a sending address by clicking on ‘Add another email address you own’ next to the Send Mail as: option. This then enables you to enter your sending address and Name to display. We would suggest you untick the Treat as an alias, but you can read more about that option from the ‘learn more’ link. Then click the Next Step. [caption id=”attachment_451” align=”aligncenter” width=”637”]<img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gmail2a.png" alt="gmail2a" /> Send mail through your SMTP server[/caption] The next option is to decide if you would like to use the SMTP of the email address to send mail. This is the better option as sending through Gmail’s servers will show the email as sent via another account. I would suggest using the SMTP server if you have those details available. So just put the SMTP server details and port and specify if the server uses a secure connection. These details can be obtained from your email service provider. Then click ‘Add Account’ and Gmail will send a verify PIN to your email address you have just setup. This is obviously a security feature to protect your email address so other can’t use it. The email will contain the PIN and also have a confirm link which you can click to save you having to enter the PIN. So now you have a web based Gmail account which can have up to 5 other email addresses being retrieved in the background and also the option of replying from Gmail rather than opening up Outlook on the home PC. <em>Just a word of warning</em>, the POP3 checker does so in intervals so don’t expect an email that was just sent to show in your Gmail inbox straight away. If you want to force it to check for new emails (like an Outlook send and receive) you CAN do this under the settings, accounts and import tab. Just click the ‘Check Now’ under the relevant email address. Feel free to comment below if you found this useful. Part one of this series can be found <a href="http://wp.me/p2G9uP-77">HERE.</a></p>

<h1 id="open-source-software-in-the-business-workspace">Open source software in the business workspace</h1>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/OSI-logo-200x235.png" alt="OSI-logo-200x235" />Open source software, as its name suggests, means the ‘source code’ is open, or given away for no cost. Traditional software companies will sell you the right to run the machine code, but with no access to the source code, and even if you had access to the source code in some way you would have no rights under their license agreement to modify it.</p>

<h3 id="hidden-costs">Hidden costs</h3>

<p>There are possible hidden costs with running open source software such as training the user on the software, which is likely to be new to them. Another area is the time taken to update things in office software like templates, macros and formulas that don’t work on the new software. Using another office software packages such as Open Office or LibreOffice rather than Microsoft Office will save money initially, but the users need for support will become a priority. They will initially be much less productive, as they learn where everything is. In time and with training they will eventually become as productive. One problem with the two examples above is although they open documents, spread sheets etc, that were created in Microsoft Office, they won’t necessarily look like or be formatted exactly as they are in Microsoft Office. Sending documents to users internally would not be a problem, but external companies might not get the document exactly as it was intended. Another issue is certain functions like complex macro’s created in Microsoft Office would not transfer to these open source alternatives, and any templates would need to be changed. Changing your operating systems to open source alternatives is probably less of a big step and would be fine for users who just need access to email and browse the web. For users of Office software this would force them to use open source software as Microsoft Office is not available on open source operating systems. The installation, running and updating of the new operating system for the IT support staff might be problematic initially and so the company might have pay a certified support company to look after the support and maintenance of the software for some time.</p>

<h1 id="changing-your-wordpress-website-password">Changing your Wordpress website password.</h1>

<p>Sometimes we see things in the news that worry us and make us want to take action, like the recent <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/security/381157/wordpress-sites-targeted-in-major-attack">Wordpress botnet attack</a>. Then you wonder maybe its too much hassle and stress to change my password. Well here is a small blog post to show you how easy it is. Please change your wordpress password as soon as you can. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/password1.png" alt="password1" /> Just log in and click on the Users option in the menu. Then you just click on the user that you would like the password changed. I would suggest changing all of them. There is only the user, admin in the picture shown (try and use complex usernames too if possible rather than the usual admin or administrator as this is even more secure). <img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/password2.png" alt="password2" /> Then just scroll down and enter your new password in both the two ‘new password’ boxes, and click Update Profile. You are done. I also suggest using a randomly generated password and a password manager such as Lastpass. We will being doing a separate post soon on Lastpass.</p>

<h1 id="raspberry-pi-car-computer">Raspberry Pi car computer</h1>

<p>I have always loved those old TV series with futuristic tech in those futuristic vehicles, like Knight Rider, Air Wolf, Street Hawk etc. So it got me thinking about how easy it would be to add a computer to a vehicle. Now I know its been done before and a quick Google search shows multiple websites and companies making very complex car and other vehicle computers, but at a large cost. [caption id=”attachment_504” align=”aligncenter” width=”625”]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-01-18.52.37-1024x768.jpg" alt="Raspberryi Pi running raspbian &quot;wheezy&quot;" /> Raspberryi Pi in my Ford Focus running raspbian “wheezy”[/caption] Well I thought my Raspberry Pi is the perfect device for this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its cheap</li>
  <li>its very small</li>
  <li>small power requirements (runs off a micro USB car charger)</li>
  <li>flexible video and audio outputs (HDMI and Composite RCA for video, HDMI and 3.5mm audio jack for audio)</li>
  <li>and best of all you can change operating systems by simply switching out SD cards
Below is a photo of the Raspberry Pi running the excellent media centre type operating system <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/">Raspbmc</a> which is perfect for browsing and playing your media collection using a media centre remote or something similar, as shown in my ‘shopping list’ below. [caption id=”attachment_505” align=”aligncenter” width=”500”]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-02-18.05.22-768x1024.jpg" alt="Raspbmc running on a Raspberry Pi" /> Raspbmc running on a Raspberry Pi in the Car[/caption] <strong>What I did</strong> Well firstly I had the Xtron car DVD player for the Ford already fitted and it can be found on this site here <a href="http://www.xtrons.co.uk/">http://www.xtrons.co.uk/</a> and there are DVD/Radio players for a number of car manufacturers. However you don’t actually need one of these if you can place a TFT screen elsewhere. I also have one of these.. [caption id=”attachment_506” align=”aligncenter” width=”300”]<img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-02-11.21.04-300x225.jpg" alt="7&quot; TFT monitor which can be used for the back seats" /> 7” TFT monitor which can be used for the back seats[/caption] Which can be found on Ebay for about £23 at this link. <a href="http://stores.ebay.co.uk/SainSpeed">http://stores.ebay.co.uk/SainSpeed</a> This 7” TFT can be placed in a headrest or on the dash somewhere as it comes with a stand. Both of these devices have a composite RCA video input and for audio I have a basic 3.5mm audio cable from the Raspberry Pi to the auxiliary port of the radio. So all audio is played via the car speakers which sounds really good and clear. I placed the Raspberry Pi in the centre console as shown below and routed all cables under the centre console so no cables are lying around.

<p><strong><a href="#704" title="2013-05-26 19:08:08">Vern</a>:</strong> Nice setup! Are you concerned at all about battery drain? The Pi pulls up to 700mA @ 5V (Or about 3.5W, which I think is about 291mA as seen by the battery on the 12V side of the USB adapter, not including loss due to the USB adapter itself or anything else plugged into the adapter). It certainly isn’t a lot, but would add up over time. If the Pi isn’t doing anything and is at idle it probably pulls less, but I don’t know a good way to estimate that. I suppose that in instances where you expect the car to be sitting for a while you could simply shut down and unplug the Pi and/or the USB adapter. I was actually toying with the idea of putting a Pi in my own car to take advantage of the AirPlay functionality in RaspBMC. Audio-only, no video for my needs. I’ll probably just stick with the bluetooth adapter until I can convince myself I need this sort of setup instead :) Another thought, if you want to get that far into it: you could rig up a 3V adapter for the wireless keyboard to do away with batteries. Again, great setup!</p>

<p><strong><a href="#693" title="2013-05-26 01:56:23">kevin</a>:</strong> Nice car! Focus rocks!</p>

<p><strong><a href="#680" title="2013-05-24 13:13:20">RedR</a>:</strong> I can not help wonder about heat issues. Any chance you could log temp values from the Pi and and post them for us? Thanks for the blog, and great job on this!</p>

<p><strong><a href="#677" title="2013-05-24 08:52:09">Tushar</a>:</strong> Nice work, Below mention url may be you liked to see. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJevH5H5wHQ&amp;autoplay=1</p>

<p><strong><a href="#676" title="2013-05-24 08:51:36">Anthony Kavassis</a>:</strong> If you’re looking to get better audio quality I would recommend using a Texas instruments USB DAC (i.e. PCM 2704) which is compatible with OpenELEC and Raspbmc. You can get one easily off Ebay for near 15-20 dollars and that’ll give you a nice clean sound from the Raspberry Pi. The one I’m using right now is a 2 channel with coaxial SPDIF output but you can get a version which also has optical SPDIF. If you combine it with an amplifier with SPDIF input (i.e. Audison amplifier which has also volume control) then the end result should be spectacular for your car. As far as power for your Raspberry Pi, it might not be necessary to shut down the Pi at all because you can run it off a USB power pack in line with your USB charger so when you take out the key from the ignition and the switched 12V is cut-off by the CAN BUS in your Ford it should leave only battery pack powering the Raspberry Pi. I tested mine with the Dension TripStick which also made it easier to get 3G access in the car and it ran a full HD video for over 2 hours and 20 minutes. I didn’t do a stand-by test but in theory it should be at least eight hours and that’ll mean that by the time you get back in your car it’ll still be running so there wouldn’t be a need to power off the Pi at all.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#665" title="2013-05-23 20:13:35">Jayson</a>:</strong> Looks great! Linked over here from the Raspberry Pi blog. I just had a couple of simple questions for you: Does the power in your center console have “always on” power, or does the power shut off when you turn the car off? If the power shuts off when you turn the ignition off, do you manually power down the RPi beforehand or just let it power down? I’m assuming now that since you replaced the stock unit, you can no longer listen to radio or manipulate balance/fader/EQ settings? Thanks for the great writeup!</p>

<p><strong><a href="#666" title="2013-05-23 20:38:35">admin</a>:</strong> Hi Jayson Basically the Pi runs off the console car charger (shown in the pic) and that happens to be constant power whether the car is off, running or on accessory. So yes I just power down the Pi using the excellent Xenta mini keyboard (also shown in a pic). Yes I can listen to radio and manipulate balance etc as the replacement radio has all that build in with an Aux input for the Raspberry Pi. It runs off Windows CE 6.0 and has Ipod connector, USB, SatNav etc. I just select Aux on the touch screen to see the Raspberry Pi. See the link for the Xtrons site for more details on this radio.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#668" title="2013-05-23 21:18:30">Jayson</a>:</strong> Ah, I get it. At first I was under the assumption that you replaced your stock stereo with a screen dedicated to the raspberry pi. I see now that Xtrons controls everything, with the raspi just acting as one of the inputs. Excellent!</p>

<p><strong><a href="#723" title="2013-05-27 23:00:16">Matthew</a>:</strong> Very well done; I am planning to do something similar in my Chevrolet Trailblazer, though I will probably mount the display somewhere out of sight if I don’t end up replacing the current head unit.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#733" title="2013-05-28 08:59:16">admin</a>:</strong> Yes basically I shut down the pi when not in use and its not usually running when the car is stopped (as the kids watch things whilst I drive) so not really worried about battery drain.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1427" title="2013-07-18 21:59:59">Dan Y</a>:</strong> A few weeks ago I setup my spare Raspberry Pi as a CarPC. I started by breaking open an old mobile phone car charger and removing the voltage regulator circuit, then I soldered the fuse directly to the voltage regulator live wire and soldered the live and ground from the voltage regulator to the back of my cigarette lighter socket, then I plugged my Pi into the voltage regulator so that its always got power (the car is a ford escort). I have left the Pi turned on with nothing playing for at least 2 days at a time with no drain on my battery. To be honest I think it would have to be left for a long time to drain a car battery so that would be the least of my worries. If you want to see my setup so far heres the link: http://www.feoc-uk.com/</p>

<p><strong><a href="#819" title="2013-06-01 01:00:42">Mike</a>:</strong> Hello, I was thinking of doing this exact thing in my focus ST. Just a quick question, where abouts did you route the phono cable to the back of the unit? and is it an easy task or fiddly as anything? Cheers</p>

<p><strong><a href="#824" title="2013-06-01 08:58:38">admin</a>:</strong> Well, very easily actually. At the back of the centre console are two holding bolts which I removed and it allowed me to lift the plastic console enough to route the cables underneath and down the side. With the radio out it is also easy to route the cables down the passenger side and then follow under the console. Hope this helps.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#866" title="2013-06-03 21:16:57">Phil</a>:</strong> Have you seen these? http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican-canbus-board-for-raspberry-pi-p-1196.html Haven’t done anything serious with the idea yet, but this looks like a possible way to control a pi-based carputer from the steering wheel buttons. Needs quite a bit of reverse engineering to figure out all the codes for the Ford MS-CAN bus but could deliver some pretty impressive integration with other vehicle systems… Interested if anyone else is looking at this for recent Fords?? Brgds Phil</p>

<p><strong><a href="#867" title="2013-06-03 22:03:26">admin</a>:</strong> Yes thanks for that. Pretty interesting.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1136" title="2013-06-18 21:53:21">admin</a>:</strong> No I can not use the radio’s touch screen as there is no input to connect to the pi and besides I probably would not find a driver for this screen. I am working on getting a touch screen working with the pi for another project. Watch this space..</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1066" title="2013-06-14 03:22:48">KJW</a>:</strong> This is pretty cool. Can you operate the pi via the touch screen or do you need to use the keyboard/mouse? kjw</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1063" title="2013-06-14 01:59:01">jeremy</a>:</strong> I’ll second the battery thing, but add in that you are using an O.S. that comes with one of the easiest programming languages to write. all you nee to do is write in a ‘if power drops below X% run shutdown’ obviously that’s much more than a paraphrase but you get the general idea, that way you can have everything run even with keys off without worry of battery cutting out. I’m liking what the android guys are working on, and as you know if you don’t like it simply pop out the drive, douse in gasoline, and see how far down if we’ll burn.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#2269" title="2013-10-31 15:11:40">In Car DVD Sat Nav Player</a>:</strong> Very informative, I’m sure this could be achieved with other aftermarket stereos than xtrons. Nice work</p>

<p><strong><a href="#3238" title="2014-05-14 04:43:25">Bill The Geek</a>:</strong> I have just discovered this in my Raspberry Pi project meaqnderings. I am looking at setting up a carputer using the Pi. I was wondering if you had made any progress with the touch screen thing you mentioned above?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#3239" title="2014-05-14 09:55:48">admin</a>:</strong> Unfortunately my uni degree has left me with little time so I have not progressed in this. I have heard the Raspberry Pi foundation are looking at releasing a touch screen especially for the Pi so I might look into this in the future.</p>

<p>Just thought I would add a few pictures showing the Headrest monitors I installed for the back seat passengers. Movies for the kids……? See my original post here <a href="http://wp.me/p2G9uP-87">http://wp.me/p2G9uP-87</a> [caption id=”attachment_516” align=”aligncenter” width=”625”]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Headrest-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Headrest Monitor Left" /> Headrest Monitor Left[/caption] [caption id=”attachment_517” align=”aligncenter” width=”625”]<img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Headrest-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="Headrest monitor right" /> Headrest monitor right[/caption]</p>

<p><strong><a href="#679" title="2013-05-24 10:13:01">admin</a>:</strong> I was lucky in that the Xtrons radio had 2 RCA outputs.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#678" title="2013-05-24 09:30:17">Gareth Jenkins</a>:</strong> How did you split the video signal to 3 displays? Did you just use a couple of passive RCA Y-splitters?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#671" title="2013-05-23 21:47:57">Kevvy Wilch</a>:</strong> OK many thanks. That’s a nice neat job.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#669" title="2013-05-23 21:27:51">Kevvy Wilch</a>:</strong> Hi, that’s pretty cool, how did you attach the screens to the head rest?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#670" title="2013-05-23 21:33:24">admin</a>:</strong> They came with a plastic recess holder and I cut into the back of the headrest like in this video here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCn6C9YmzpA</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1219" title="2013-06-24 21:30:18">Paul</a>:</strong> Did you see any banding on the TFT Color Monitors whilst Raspbmc was running? I have a setup similar to this but the monitor is plugged directly into the video out on the Pi…</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1470" title="2013-07-26 19:24:56">Adrian</a>:</strong> How did you supply power to the 7” LCD screen? I am doing a similar setup in my car and was trying to power it through a cigarette lighter USB charger, but it only pushes 5v at 1A which was not enough for the screen. I was thinking of using the power going into the cigarette directly, but not sure if its too much for the LCD screen.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#953" title="2013-06-08 09:46:20">admin</a>:</strong> I agree, the audio from the analog 3.5mm jack is a bit hissy at low volumes. Once you are driving and kids are watching a movie, with the volume turned up, it is less noticeable. I will be investigating ways to improve this at some point.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#916" title="2013-06-06 07:24:56">Dan</a>:</strong> Hi, Did you have to run any filters for the sound? I find when a device is plugged unto the 12V it tends to get a whining sound through the speakers under acceleration. Did you experience this an if so how did you combat it? Cheers Dan</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1967" title="2013-09-19 00:49:03">Justin</a>:</strong> That noise you hear when accelerating is electrical feedback from the engine. All you need is a in-line audio filter to filter out the current of electricity.</p>

<h1 id="meraki-wireless-access-points---cloud-based-configuration-for-switches-and-access-points">Meraki wireless access points - cloud based configuration for switches and access points</h1>

<p>Been playing around with a <a href="http://meraki.cisco.com/">Meraki Wireless Access Point</a> for some time now and its amazing how cloud technology opens up areas of real usefulness. With cloud based access to all your access point settings enables some interesting uses. This would work perfectly in a coffee shop or hotel reception to give your guests or customers wireless internet access, but being in complete control of everything including bandwidth usage, blocking certain applications and ports. One excellent feature is the access points ability to be powered over a POE switch so placing the device is much less of a hassle. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/20130618-221208.jpg" alt="20130618-221208.jpg" /></p>

<h1 id="disable-the-new-email-via-your-google-profile">Disable the NEW email via your Google+ profile</h1>

<p>There is a new Gmail feature that Google have sneaked in that allows anyone to email you via your Google+ profile even if they are a complete stranger. Someone just needs to add you to their circles and they then have the ability to email you direct (without seeing your email address though) even if you have not added them back. The default for this feature is on, but I will show you below how to turn it off. Google have added some security by allowing this to happen only once, unless you respond to their first email. The first email will also be filtered into the Social category of the inbox (if enabled). It still opens up the ability for automated programs to do this on a mass scale to spam a huge amount of Google+ users, even if just once. This might annoy a lot of people in a very short space of time. Log into your Gmail account via a PC as this can’t be done via an smartphone or tablet app. Click on the cogwheel button at the top right, then click on settings. You will get some tabs and General should be the default tab that you land on. See below. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/googleplus-1024x316.png" alt="googleplus" />   Scroll down until you see the [Email via Google+] option and click the dropdown as shown above. Change this to Circles or No one, depending on whether you want people in your Circles to email you or not. Then make sure you scroll down and click the Save Changes button. Let me know via the comments if you succeed or have any trouble doing this.</p>
