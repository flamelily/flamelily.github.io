      <p>There is a new Gmail feature that Google have sneaked in that allows anyone to email you via your Google+ profile even if they are a complete stranger. Someone just needs to add you to their circles and they then have the ability to email you direct (without seeing your email address though) even if you have not added them back. The default for this feature is on, but I will show you below how to turn it off. Google have added some security by allowing this to happen only once, unless you respond to their first email.</p>

Now I know its been done before and a quick Google search shows multiple websites and companies making very complex car and other vehicle computers, but at a large cost.</p>

Traditional software companies will sell you the right to run the machine code, but with no access to the source code, and even if you had access to the source code in some way you would have no rights under their license agreement to modify it.</p>

Firstly we are going to show you how to use filters. Filters that you setup in browser based gmail will action before you get emails to your smartphone or tablet, so can be very useful.</p>

      <p>To move wordpress sites to different servers can be a little complex. You need to move both the database and RAW folders and files. <em>If you are moving to a different server, but keeping the same domain name:</em> First export your database using PHP Myadmin or any other tool to get your SQL file. Webmin can export databases into SQL. Create a new empty database on your new server. This can have different names and passwords. Then using an FTP client copy your whole website structure from the root folder and import it to your root folder on the new server.</p>

      <p>Having used wordpress for a number of years now, one of the things that can be a pain is backing up your site. We have tried a number of options, some successful and some not so much. Of course when you back up a wordpress site you need to both backup the raw files and images as well as the database. There are a number of wordpress database tools for both backup and things like optimising your database. Once such plugin is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-dbmanager/">WP-DBManager</a>. We have used this with great success and has a number of features. But this obviously only gives you an SQL backup file and does not help if you need to fully restore a site.</p>

      <p>The news about <a href="http://atos.net/en-us/about_us/zero_email/default.htm">Atos’ ‘zero email’ policy</a> a while back had us thinking seriously about the implications. Now firstly, to be clear, the Atos ‘zero email’ is ONLY to do with internal email. In other words only internal communication between Atos employees will have to be done using other forms of communications and not email. The press, when this was reported, did not really make this clear, and I think a lot of people (including us) thought it a rather crazy thing to do. In the BBC’s story <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16055310">HERE</a> word’s like ‘stupid’ were apparently used. Atos boss Thierry Breton would like this to happen by 2014.</p>

With our expertise in VOIP we can setup any U.K area code phone numbers that can go to a specific message for people or companies to leave a message.</p>

      <p>Host Virtual are a popular virtual machine provider with a great support team.  But what I find is their biggest selling point is their shear number of OS images they have ready for you to deploy. They have over 25 Linux distributions and over 150 base images to use. They have some great VOIP images including Pbxinaflash, Trixbox and Freepbx. Also they have things like FreeBSD, ArchLinux and Slackware.</p>

      <p>EFM or Ethernet in the First Mile is a great technology for small to large business looking to dump the old analog lines and move over exclusively to VOIP. Being a symmetric service (same bandwidth upstream and downstream) it really does give your internet that feeling of ‘FAST’.  I think this will be an exciting technology for the company looking to drop all old analog lines and move primaraly to a VOIP telephony platform.</p>

      <p>I have had a lot of deliveries in the run up to Christmas and have been impressed with the ability of the on-line stores and couriers to make their deliveries. Even companies like Ocado have been ‘thinking out the box’ and fitting <a href="http://www.ocado.com/theocadoway/talking%20ocado/2010/snow-business.html">snow tires to their vehicles</a>. This is a testament to on-line stores and delivery companies as I think they realise lots of people have been staying indoors so their service has been crucial to the smooth running of everyone’s Christmas. We all tend to complain about the lack of service in the U.K, but I would like to say we should appreciate what they do when things like the weather go against them….</p>

      <p>There are a lot of Orange HTC owners out there waiting to get the latest Android 2.1 update and not receiving it. Well click this link below and you will see that it might be because you have not updated it to the 2.73.61.66 firmware from the HTC U.K support page. This is a manual update which you need to use the HTC sync software installed on a windows PC to do. This will wipe the phone unfortunately of all settings, apps etc, but from then on you will get the ‘Over the Air’ updates that do keep your settings. Follow the instructions from the link below to get Android 2.1 on your Orange HTC Hero…… <a href="http://www.htc.com/uk/faqs.aspx?p_id=283&amp;cat=86&amp;id=136932">http://www.htc.com/uk/faqs.aspx?p_id=283&amp;cat=86&amp;id=136932</a></p>

      <p>Being playing around with <a href="http://www3.formassembly.com/">FormAssembly</a> recently with some sucess. This is a great tool for online forms and data collection. They have a Salesforce app, Wordpress app and a Google sites tool.</p>

      <p>I think apple have missed a trick by not having a USB port on the iPad. Can you imagine be able to tether a wifi only iPad to your iPhone or other mobile like the HTC desire I blogged about previously. Nearly £100 saving by buying the Wifi only version.</p>

      <p>I recently posted about the HTC Legend being a good choice for a new phone. Well it is a great phone, but I think the HTC desire is the new king of the smartphones. Don’t take my word for it, read the review in the link below… <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/smartphones/357478/htc-desire">PC Pro Review</a></p>

      <p><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-mail-is-becoming-gmail-in-uk.html">Google Blog by Greg Bullock</a> Finally Google has managed to sort out the issues with the Gmail.com domain use in the U.K. As the above link shows you will now be able to convert your @googlemail.com email to the easier to type @gmail.com Not many people knew that if you had an @googlemail.com address and someone sent you an email to @gmail.com you still received it. This was clever by Google to still route these emails to your inbox and obviously the Google ID (the bit before the @ sign) is unique to @googlemail and @gmail at the same time so as I see it anyone can convert their email to (theirID@gmail.com).</p>
