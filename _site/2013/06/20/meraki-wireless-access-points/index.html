<p>Been playing around with a <a href="http://meraki.cisco.com/">Meraki Wireless Access Point</a> for some time now and its amazing how cloud technology opens up areas of real usefulness. With cloud based access to all your access point settings enables some interesting uses. This would work perfectly in a coffee shop or hotel reception to give your guests or customers wireless internet access, but being in complete control of everything including bandwidth usage, blocking certain applications and ports. One excellent feature is the access points ability to be powered over a POE switch so placing the device is much less of a hassle. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/20130618-221208.jpg" alt="20130618-221208.jpg" /></p>
