<h1 id="playing-with-gimp">Playing with GIMP</h1>

<p>Just playing around with GIMP which is an excellent image manipulation software and is free under the GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL. I created this image using the text tools within <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP.</a> <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Batman.png" alt="Batman" /></p>
