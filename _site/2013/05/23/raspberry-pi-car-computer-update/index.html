<p>Just thought I would add a few pictures showing the Headrest monitors I installed for the back seat passengers. Movies for the kids……? See my original post here <a href="http://wp.me/p2G9uP-87">http://wp.me/p2G9uP-87</a> [caption id=”attachment_516” align=”aligncenter” width=”625”]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Headrest-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Headrest Monitor Left" /> Headrest Monitor Left[/caption] [caption id=”attachment_517” align=”aligncenter” width=”625”]<img src="http://www.flamelily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Headrest-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="Headrest monitor right" /> Headrest monitor right[/caption]</p>

<p><strong><a href="#679" title="2013-05-24 10:13:01">admin</a>:</strong> I was lucky in that the Xtrons radio had 2 RCA outputs.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#678" title="2013-05-24 09:30:17">Gareth Jenkins</a>:</strong> How did you split the video signal to 3 displays? Did you just use a couple of passive RCA Y-splitters?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#671" title="2013-05-23 21:47:57">Kevvy Wilch</a>:</strong> OK many thanks. That’s a nice neat job.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#669" title="2013-05-23 21:27:51">Kevvy Wilch</a>:</strong> Hi, that’s pretty cool, how did you attach the screens to the head rest?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#670" title="2013-05-23 21:33:24">admin</a>:</strong> They came with a plastic recess holder and I cut into the back of the headrest like in this video here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCn6C9YmzpA</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1219" title="2013-06-24 21:30:18">Paul</a>:</strong> Did you see any banding on the TFT Color Monitors whilst Raspbmc was running? I have a setup similar to this but the monitor is plugged directly into the video out on the Pi…</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1470" title="2013-07-26 19:24:56">Adrian</a>:</strong> How did you supply power to the 7” LCD screen? I am doing a similar setup in my car and was trying to power it through a cigarette lighter USB charger, but it only pushes 5v at 1A which was not enough for the screen. I was thinking of using the power going into the cigarette directly, but not sure if its too much for the LCD screen.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#953" title="2013-06-08 09:46:20">admin</a>:</strong> I agree, the audio from the analog 3.5mm jack is a bit hissy at low volumes. Once you are driving and kids are watching a movie, with the volume turned up, it is less noticeable. I will be investigating ways to improve this at some point.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#916" title="2013-06-06 07:24:56">Dan</a>:</strong> Hi, Did you have to run any filters for the sound? I find when a device is plugged unto the 12V it tends to get a whining sound through the speakers under acceleration. Did you experience this an if so how did you combat it? Cheers Dan</p>

<p><strong><a href="#1967" title="2013-09-19 00:49:03">Justin</a>:</strong> That noise you hear when accelerating is electrical feedback from the engine. All you need is a in-line audio filter to filter out the current of electricity.</p>
