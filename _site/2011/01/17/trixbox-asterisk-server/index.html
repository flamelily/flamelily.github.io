<h1 id="trixbox-asterisk-server">Trixbox Asterisk Server</h1>

<p>Trixbox Asterisk Server based on a HP Proliant DL rack server. Trixbox CE pre-installed and configured with a FREE outgoing SIP trunk from Gradwell.  Can be installed at your premises at additional cost. You will need a static IP address to set this up. I suggest creating a subdomain like sip.mydomain.com that is directed to your static IP address for easy configuration.  </p>

<h1 id="only-699-with-free-trunk">Only £699 with FREE trunk</h1>

<p>If you are interested in this or need any other assistance then please call or fill in <a href="/contact.html">THIS FORM</a> and you will be contacted soon. The FREE outgoing SIP trunk will be supplied once a direct debit or credit card mandate has been set-up for outgoing calls, and £10 call credit is taken. Call charges can be found <a href="http://www.gradwell.com/phoneservices/callcharges">here.</a> We can set-up an outgoing CLI for your outbound calls for a small one off charge once we have received proof you own the number. We can supply VOIP phones configured for use with the server if needed.</p>
