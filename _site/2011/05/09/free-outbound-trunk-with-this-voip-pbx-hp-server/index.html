<h1 id="free-outbound-trunk-with-this-voip-pbx-hp-server">Free outbound trunk with this VOIP PBX HP Server</h1>

<p>PBX in a flash based Asterisk Server based on a HP Proliant N36L server. PBX in a flash pre-installed and configured with a FREE outgoing SIP trunk from Gradwell.  Can be installed at your premises at additional cost. You will need a static IP address to set this up. I suggest creating a subdomain like sip.mydomain.com that is directed to your static IP address for easy configuration. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/HP.jpg" alt="" />  </p>

<h1 id="only-529-with-free-trunk">Only £529 with FREE trunk</h1>

<p>If you are interested in this or need any other assistance then please call or fill in <a href="/contact.html">THIS FORM</a> and you will be contacted soon. The FREE outgoing SIP trunk will be supplied once a direct debit or credit card mandate has been set-up for outgoing calls, and £10 call credit is taken. Call charges can be found <a href="http://www.gradwell.com/phoneservices/callcharges">here.</a> We can set-up an outgoing CLI for your outbound calls for a small one off charge once we have received proof you own the number. We can supply VOIP phones configured for use with the server if needed.</p>
